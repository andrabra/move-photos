# Move photos script

## With this script, you can move files with specific names from the specified directory to another.

It will be enough to change the path to the source and destination directories, as well as insert the necessary file names.

## Example of code
```
# Path to the source folder where the source_folder files
source_folder = ''

# Path to the folder to move the files
destination_folder = ''

# List of files to transfer
files_to_move = []
```
